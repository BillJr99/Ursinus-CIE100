## Purpose/Context \[[^1]\]

This paper is an opportunity to pursue how the CIE texts may have influenced your thinking around the four questions, OR to explore a concept that arises in the texts that has been of interest to you, but hasn't been feasible in the prompts to date. We've read these texts on our own, discussed them in class, and now it's time to return to the texts and dig deeper.

In our first two papers, we worked on integrating thought-provoking analysis of the texts into our essays, and how to build an insightful thesis statement. We will continue to apply and build on these skills, while now adding a focus on the content of the paragraphs and how they support the argument of our paper.

##Writing Prompts (Choose one!)

### CIE and the Four Questions (from the CIE Working Group)

The Ursinus Quest is focused on helping us answer four questions; what should matter to us, how should we live our lives, how can we understand the world, and what will we do. In this essay reflect on how 2-3 of the texts we have read during CIE have combined to affect our answer to at least one of these questions.

The personal nature of this assignments means that we will devote some words to what we thought before, what we think now and why our thinking has changed. However, **engagement with the texts is crucial** , especially as they are what altered our thinking.

**Our task:** Consider the above prompt by doing the following: (a) choosing two texts from the semester that have confronted of changed our way of think or perception of the world, (b) reflect on how the texts considers considered a particular idea or concept differently then you have before, (c) reflect on your reaction to encountering an alternative perspective and (d) explore the ways the text has complicated your answers to the four questions.

### Why did the Ursinus faculty make me read that? (from the CIE Working Group)

Write a formal, thesis-driven proposal explaining why 2-3 readings from the CIE 100 syllabus should be retained and/or deleted for next year. To do so will require that we explain how the chosen text answers a specific CIE question (or sub-question) in an interesting way, _or_ that we explain how a text fails to do so. In other words, we will need to ground our argument in a larger thesis about the purpose of the course (see description of course and learning objectives in our syllabus) and the extent to which these particular readings accomplish that goal. So, although the course has many goals, for this particular paper we need to be very specific about which aspects of those goals the texts address and how.

**Our task:** When considering the above prompt note that it is not simply enough to say we like/do not like a text. We must (_a) explore a text's meaning and merits or lack thereof, (b) offer an intelligent critique grounded in a larger overarching thesis for texts we do not like and (c) discuss what aspects of the texts are especially powerful and how they connect to the particular aspects of the course we are exploring._

### The Ursinus Questions and Biblical Teachings

Earlier this semester, Rabbi David Wolpe visited Ursinus to give a talk entitled, “Get Over Yourself: Self-Transcendence in the Book of Genesis.” It focused on how biblical characters, particularly in Genesis, grow beyond their limitations. 

We also read several biblical passages, including the Sermon on the Mount, the Good Samaritan, and Genesis.  Reflecting upon these passages and Rabbi Wolpe's talk, discuss ways in which one's academic pursuits might be best placed for the good of humanity.  One could, for example, acquire a lifetime of knowledge, and then pass on before putting it to use.  Alternatively, one might seek to be known for some success or accomplishment as their "reward" for a lifetime of learning (akin to a billionaire becoming a philanthropist late in life).  

Thinking about the Ursinus Questions, these biblical passages, and other texts of your choosing (including The Matrix), take a position on the purpose of education, and what obligations, if any, one should consider as a result of the gift of learning.

## Writing Goals

- A thesis statement that is debatable, concise, clear, indicative of our essay's argument, detailed, specific, and insightful.
- A clear understanding of the texts and their influence on our thinking, as demonstrated by careful quotation and paraphrasing accompanied by a clear explanation of their significance to our thesis
- A logical organization in which each paragraph clearly advances a distinct point and builds upon the last to pursue a larger claim
- Lively, distinctive, original voice.
- Clear, dynamic sentences; accurate, varied diction; lack of grammar and spelling mistakes.
- One of the goals of CIE is to develop a process of writing that includes incorporating feedback and substantial revision. There needs to be substantive change between the first and final draft. Submitting a slightly edited, or unedited, version of the first draft does not reflect the development of a writing process.

Our writing will be assessed based on how well we meet these goals.

## Submission Requirements:

Whichever option you choose, the following requirements need to be meet:

- The essay should be **1500-1800 words**
- **Essay must include quotes from at least two of our CIE texts**.
- The essay must be typed, double-spaced, in 12-point font
- Do not include a cover page.
- Include your name on the document
- Every essay should have an informative and interesting title. Titles such as "Essay 3", "CIE Essay on Education,", "Sappho Essay", etcetera, don't count.
